When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When developing a professional software (so you can work remotely) and to allow collaboration. Personaly I'd ALWAYS use remote repo.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In a similar way to commits, push/pull manually gives the best control over the process and avoid unnecessary data transfer.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks operate on GitHub only. Its the same process as a clone, but internally on GitHub
Clones operate both local or remote. You can clone a repo from GitHub (or any other git server) to your local computer, or you can clone locally from a folder to another
Branches are contained within a repo and can be pushed and pulled

When to use each:

FORK to clone a repo from someone's GitHub to your own GitHub account
CLONE to clone a repo from GitHub (or any other git server) to your local computer
You can also CLONE a repo from your computer to another location on the same computer
BRANCH to create separate variations of your code, useful when testing new feature before you decide to incorporate them, so the master branch can keep stable
