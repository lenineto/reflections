When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When developing a professional software (so you can work remotely) and to allow collaboration. Personaly I'd ALWAYS use remote repo.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In a similar way to commits, push/pull manually gives the best control over the process and avoid unnecessary data transfer.
